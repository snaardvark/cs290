#drewsm - basic bio info
Who has time for hobbies? When I had a hobby, so to speak, it was hunting
edible mushrooms in the forest.  In the late spring morels come out.  In the
autumn it's chantrelles.

I have more interests than I could name, but the one that takes up most of my
time and attention is information / cyber-security.  That has been my career
path for the past 10 years.  I participate in several security-focused
organizations with meetings around the region.  I find this both intellectually
stimulating and to create opportunities for career growth.  So, I do take
a lot of personal time going to information security meetings and conferences.

#Programming Background
My first taste of computer programming was with Basic back in high school.
The year was 1982.  We were typing our programs on a character terminal
interfaced with, what was described to us as a "mainframe".  For all I know
it may have just been a Unix system.  We got our program run output from a
teletype.

I had a Texas Instruments TI-99 at home
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A) and a Basic language
ROM cartridge. I programmed myself a "snafu" snake-type game that actually
worked perfectly, but ran so pathetically slowly as to be unusable for
practical play. I was able to save my programs to an audio cassette recorder 
with a simple RCA cable onto a $0.66 audio tape.

I dabbled in a little bit of shell scripting over the years for system
administration purposes and did some light modifications to perl scripts
I had inherited, but my next real experience with programming didn't come until
I started CS161 at OSU in the fall of 2014.
