#drewsm - basic bio info
Who has time for hobbies? When I had a hobby, so to speak, it was hunting
edible mushrooms in the forest.  In the late spring morels come out.  In the
autumn it's chantrelles. Right now, as spring advances, we will be trying to
gauge the right time to get out and hunt the elusive morel. When we were living
in Oregon we knew the right time and the places to go; but now that we're in
Michigan we're still trying to figure it out.

Until beginning my studies in the OSU post-bacc CS program, I would have said
the main thing that engages my time outside of work was my children.  Now that
my kids are a bit older and don't require such constant attention, my wife and
I agreed that we would be able together to still provide the presence and
guidance they need. For the past 16 years, I would say my main pursuit was
just taking care of the family; taking kids to basketball games and 
overseeing school activities.

I have more interests than I could name, but other than family, the one that 
takes up most of my time and attention is information / cyber-security.  That 
has been my career path for the past 10 years.  I participate in several 
security-focused organizations with meetings around the region.  I find this 
both intellectually stimulating and to create opportunities for career growth.
So, I do take a lot of personal time going to information security meetings and
conferences.

#Programming Background
My first taste of computer programming was with Basic back in high school.
The year was 1982.  We were typing our programs on a character terminal
interfaced with, what was described to us as a "mainframe".  For all I know
it may have just been a Unix system.  We got our program run output from a
teletype.

I had a Texas Instruments TI-99 at home
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A) and a Basic language
ROM cartridge. I programmed myself a "snafu" snake-type game that actually
worked perfectly, but ran so pathetically slowly as to be unusable for
practical play. I was able to save my programs to an audio cassette recorder 
with a simple RCA cable onto a $0.66 audio tape.

I dabbled in a little bit of shell scripting over the years for system
administration purposes and did some light modifications to perl scripts
I had inherited, but my next real experience with programming didn't come until
I started CS161 at OSU in the fall of 2014.

My favorite assignment in the OSU CS program so far has been the first big
assignment in CS162, which I took Winter 2015.  That assignment was to
implement Conway's Game of Life.  This theme was particularly interesting to
me because a fictional version of a much more advanced cellular automaton is
a big feature in one of my favorite science fiction books, "Permutation City"
by Greg Egan. I highly recommend it as a good read. Prompted by the book, I had
already done a little bit of research into these topics and some of the theory
behind cellular automata, including Stephan Wolfram's research.  I'm not sure,
but based on the class discussions in Canvas, it seems that I made some choices
for program design that may have been unique in the class.  I am not aware of
anybody else, for instance, that used the wrap-around "toroidal" grid geometry.
After reading about that design, it just seemed to me it would be simpler to
implement than tracking object progress beyond the display.  Some simple mode
calculations made it easy to figure out coordinates for adjoining cells, even
when they were way on the other side of the screen.

#Adding some more content for assignment step 12
I will use this section to note a little bit about how I intend to use a degree
in computer science and the knowledge from this class. I've alluded to my
career involving information/cyber-security.  Currently, I'm in a position of
testing application security.  A lot of that testing involves just using some
scanning tools to look for vulnerabilities.  But soon we will be implementing
static testing tools that I want to be able to use most effectively. I envision
leveraging knowledge and qualifications from this CS program to move toward
more of an analyst role on my current team.  I also felt that my earlier work 
with platform and network security, governance and risk management would be
more rounded out with more knowledge of software securityand development
practices.

I will be attending a SANS Institute course on web application security very
soon and I'm hoping that this current course will give me the background to
make sense of the content in the SANS course and be best able to apply it in my
job later.
