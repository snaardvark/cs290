#drewsm - basic bio info
Who has time for hobbies? When I had a hobby, so to speak, it was hunting
edible mushrooms in the forest.  In the late spring morels come out.  In the
autumn it's chantrelles. Right now, as spring advances, we will be trying to
gauge the right time to get out and hunt the elusive morel. When we were living
in Oregon we knew the right time and the places to go; but now that we're in
Michigan we're still trying to figure it out.

Until beginning my studies in the OSU post-bacc CS program, I would have said
the main thing that engages my time outside of work was my children.  Now that
my kids are a bit older and don't require such constant attention, my wife and
I agreed that we would be able together to still provide the presence and
guidance they need. For the past 16 years, I would say my main pursuit was
just taking care of the family; taking kids to basketball games and 
overseeing school activities.

I have more interests than I could name, but other than family, the one that 
takes up most of my time and attention is information / cyber-security.  That 
has been my career path for the past 10 years.  I participate in several 
security-focused organizations with meetings around the region.  I find this 
both intellectually stimulating and to create opportunities for career growth.
So, I do take a lot of personal time going to information security meetings and
conferences.
